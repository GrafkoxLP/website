You are Joe Bama, a cop living in the the futuristic city of Zail. You have a laser pistol and a stunner. You are part of a police unit tasked with finding government criticizers. You wake up in the morning and hear on the radio that three such people, two men and a woman, have been captured in a factory.

 You interrogate them.
You walk into the room where the three dissidents are waiting and see them looking down at their feet.
"You're Bama, right?" one of them asks.
"Right. Why are you lot snitches?"

 You put the Woman under Pressure.
"You don't seem to be worried," the woman says.
"Weren't you listening? They're terrorists."
"How can you say that? We haven't done anything wrong."

 You say "Do you have any accomplices"
"No, but there are others like us out there."
"What do you mean?"
"Well, like I said, we have concerns about the government."

 You say "Do you know where others could be"
"Probably. I have friends who have contacts. But look, we're sick of being in the city, we want to get out there are some place green."
"What's your name?"

 You say "And Where are these Friends"
"Lucas, and they're back at my place."
"Let's go."
You, Lucas and your other two companions walk out of the factory and head back to your apartment.
Youre now in front of the Apartment Door

 You say "So Lucas this is where we part ways"


 You shoot Lucas and his Companions with Laser Pistol.
You open fire with your laser pistol, hitting Lucas in the chest. He falls back, and you open fire on him again, hitting him in the head. His head explodes as his body falls backwards.

 You pick the door lock.
You turn the knob to reveal the door is locked. You aim your pistol at the lock and fire, melting the lock into uselessness.
"Come on!" Kelso calls out.

 You say "Who is there"
"Citizens!" someone calls back.
"We're policemen!"
"What do you want?"
"What's your name?"
"Officeric Kelso, with the Zail Police."

 You say "Im am a Cop too"
"Alright, don't hurt us."
You open the door and find Kelso's words to be true. You two enter the apartment and see Lucas' two friends sitting on the floor looking up at you.

 You say "Are you the Friends of Lucas"
"Yeah."
"What's your names?"
"David and..." the younger looking one says, before the elder cuts him off.
"William."
"I'm Amadeus."

 You say "Lucas said you have Contacts"
"Maybe, but not the ones you're looking for."
"What do you mean?," you ask.
"Well, we don't have a physical contact list, but we do have an email list."

 You say "Show me the Email list"
William fishes out his cell phone and sends you a few quick emails, at the same time trying to motion you to come with him.

 You follow him.
You follow William out of the apartment and into the hallway, where he begins fumbling with his phone, pressing a few buttons at random.
"What are you doing?"

 You say "Do you have them now or not"
William seems to be searching for the contact names, and then quickly types one in.
"Got it!" he says, and then rapidly presses a few more buttons. "Here we go...!"

 You say "and?"
William holds up the phone to you.
"Yeah, it's just one of them," he says.
You press the button to reveal the contact's details.

 You reveal Contact details.
Name: Sebastian De La Vega
Company: ZP Industries (Private Military Contracting)
Financial Status: Billionare
Bio: Was a member of the cyber-terrorism group "Us justice"

 You say "Do you know Sebastian De La Vega"
"Yeah, I do."
"Do you know where he is now?"
"Well, I can tell you that he is somewhere in New York," William says.
"What do you want to do?"
You take out an Experimental Poison and Inject William with it
William starts to Tumble as he begins to turn blue.
"Oh my god, help me! Help me!" he begs.
"What do you think I'm doing?" you say in a bored tone.
You wait till he drops dead
You take Williams phone and possessions and start draging him into his apartment building. After about five minutes of walking, Kelso stops you.
"Hey what the hell man, my shift doesn't start for another hour."
"Yeah well my shift just ended," you say.

 You take out Williams phone and call Sebastian De La Vega and Say you need to meet immediatly


"What are you doing?"
"I'm giving you another way out of this city, just like I had one of my men do with you once before," Sebastian says.

 You say "No i cant we need meet now!"
"What?" Sebastian asks.
"I need to meet with you," you say.
"Well I don't have time for this, if you don't clear off..."

 You hang up.
Sebasat hangs up on you
"You know, you really handled that poorly," Kelso says.
"Well he hung up on me," you reply.

 You find out where Sebastian Lives.

Sebasat has a penthouse apartment in the heart of the city.
You find out how to get there without Kelso leading you wrongfully, and begin heading that way.
You Arrived at the Penthouse door at Night.
You knock on the door, and a butler opens.
"Can I help you," he says in a monotone voice.


 You pull out you Lase Pistol and tell him that if he doesnt help you kill sebastian you will kill him.

The Butler complies and tells you "what do i need to do".

 You say "You need bring him a Drink with this deadly Poison in it"
The Butler complies and heads off to get the Drink. meanwhile Sebastian is Waking up in his Bedroom.
"I'm not going to fall for this again" he says as he tries to get out of bed. in the mean time the butler arrives with the Drink and gives it to seb.
"Thank you" seb says as he begins to Drink it.
Meanwhile you have put the Poison on the outside of the Licking Licker and begin taking slow, small sips out of the glass.
"Hmm, this isn't working as well as it should" you think.
Seb proceeds to Drink the entire glass of wine and falls to the floor comatose.

 You check if hes dead.
Seb is Dead!
"Ah, you see it didn't work. good thing you listened to me though!"
"You mean the poison didn't work" a voice says.
You turn around and see Sebastian with a huge grin on his face, followed by Kelso.

 You say "WTF Kelso what are you doing here"
"I'm helping" he replies.
Suddenly you feel a sharp prick in your neck. You fall to the floor and Kelso has injected your neck with a huge needle filled with Blue liquid.
"This is just a sedative so you wont feel any pain and you'll sleep for a few hours. Don't worry! By the time you wake up you'll be in Pennsylvania!"
Kelso and Sebastian begin Laughing as you pass out.
Your Dream.....
You see yourself as a child, around five years old.
You rember the time when you lost your Brother, Frank.
You, your Mom and Dad were on a long car ride to see Grandma.
The three of you are in the back seat of the car.
then suddenly you Blackout
and Wake up next to a Car wreck, with a few cuts and bruises, but alive!
You look around and notice that you are next to the bodies of your Mom and Dad and Your Brother.
You run over to them.
"Dad! Mom! Frank!"
No one responds, they are all corpses.
You sit there and cry over the corpse of your family, then notice a Hand putting a $20 bill in your shirt pocket.
"Someone left this behind."
You look over and see a man in a nice suit and tie. Beside him is a clean, though run down car.
"Where is my Mom and Dad?" you ask him.
"Your Dad is dead, he was in that car crash over there." He points to the Car crash on the way to Grandma's.
"That crash killed three people, your Dad, your Mom and your Brother Frank". 
"I already know that, that's why I'm asking where my brother is. He is not dead."
"I'm very sorry to tell you that your brother Frank died in that crash as well".
"No he didn't!" you shout.
"I'm sorry, I saw his body being taken out on a stretcher, I even heard his heartbeat stop."
You wake up in Alley Way in the Baddest part of Zail the last you rember is that Sebastian and Kelso Knocked you out The first thing you do is look for Kelso and Sebastian, but they are both long gone.
You check your pockets and you find a crumpled bill with a ZZ on it.
"ZZZ" You think. What does that mean?
You Check your phone, it's dead.
Your resolve now Fluctuating between revenge and Going Home, you decide to get Revenge.
Theres two ways you can think of to get it. The first being The Legal Way and the Second being The Illegal Way.
OR
You go home and Charge your phone so you can look up ZZ's online


 You take the illegal way.

"Well, I'm done waiting around. I'm going to get my revenge." You mutter and exit the alleyway.
its Raining. You look up and down the Street for Anyone. then you suddenly See Sebastian running down the Street, He is holding something.


 You follow him inconspicuously.

You sneak up behind Sebastian and Knock him out. Sebastian Screams out before You Put your hand over his mouth.
His screams are muffled by Your hand.
You know that at this time no one is out and you can carry him back to your place.

After About a minute of jogging home, Sebastian's weight straining your arm, You finally arrive at the entrance to Your Complex.
You walk through and kick the Door open with Sebastian in tow.
You get to your Apartment and Tie Sebastian to a chair inside Your Living Room. Then you Go and get a Bottle of Wine.
After You Come Back, You sit Down with Sebastian , but he just looks at You.
"That's because he's still unconscious, Nice Job" A voice in your Head remarks.
"Shut up" You mumble.
"Anyway, it's time for your News, What are you going to do with poor Sebastian?"
"Kill him of course."

 You wait till Sebastian wakes up.
After Twenty Minutes of waiting, Sebastian finally wakes up.
"Hey...what am I doing here" Sebastian mutters.

 You say "You will see"


 You say "i will send Kelso a little message"

You set up a Camera in front of Sebastian who is still tied to a chair with a distressed look on his face. You hit Record
You go up to Sebastian and cut off one of his fingers
Sebastian start crying out in pain and yelling non-stop. You find this to be highly amusing.
"Ha Ha Ha, If you think that was bad Kelso is going to freak out when he sees this" you say to yourself as you stick the finger in a nearby trashcan.
"Now I really will enjoy watching Kelso's expression when he finds out what I have done."
You Stab Sebastian in the Eye killing him instantly
you dispose of the body at the dumpster in the basement
you send Kelso the Footage of you killing Sebastian and tell him hes next.
Your little Game of Revenge has been Entertaining and Exhausting all at once.
You Quickly Prepare for bed and fall Asleep.
The Morning Comes, and so Do new Problems.

 You get out of bed.
You stare at Your Phone and Wonder what Kelso will do when he sees what you did to Sebastian
You Enter the Apartment and Check the Mail
Nothing but Junk Mail
You decide to go get something to eat. Your Arm is aching and Your Head Fuzzy, Must be all the Wine last night.
You arrive at a Small 24-hour diner and Order a Meat Lover's Pizza and a Soda. You Find a table to sit at in the middle of the restaurant.
You sit there and Eat your Pizza as you Watch People Come and Go.
Suddenly you See a Man enter the diner. Its Kelso.
"Shitty place waitress please don't tell him Im here" you think to yourself.
"Hey bartender could I have some change for my mostly empty cup" Kelso Says
The Bartender arrives and gives Kelso some coins. Kelso Thanks him and leaves.

You think to yourself "that was close"
You go Home and Start planning for Breaking in Kelsos Home.
You'll need Crowbar,Laser Cutter, and possibly a Gun.
--
You Think about what would be the Best Way to get Inside.
You can Try to go trough the Back door in the Carden but theres a big fence around the garden.
You could Try to cut the Lock on the Backdoor with the Laser cutter and Enter trough the Back door or go through a Window. Either way you'll have to be careful not to be Caught.
--
You Decide to go with the Back Door option.
you wait till midnight and then you start your Work.
The Laser barely cuts a few inches into the Door before it shuts down.
You try to burn throug the lock with the laser cutter but the machine shuts down due to overuse.
"What the hell, must be a pretty tough lock for it to overheat already" You mumble as you Try the windows first.
you use the Laser Cutter on the window and easily seperates the Glass from the metal frame.
you climb inside and make your Way through the House.

After A Few try of Wrenching the Door off the lock you Find yourself In Kelso's Living Room.
you find his wife sleeping on the Couch
you find out that Kelso is not at Home and Decide to Kidnapp his Wife.
You Take out the Needle and Get it In Your Fingertip Ready.
you press it to the Ears of Kelso's Sleeping wife and Slowly inject her with a Very Powerful Sedative.
Then you grab her and leave.
You leave the House and Walk out into the Morning.
"Perfect, nobody is around" you think as you Start walking.
you walk for about an Hour and find the nearest Taxi and get in the Taxi. the Taximan asks "why is she Knockedout"
you lie and Say "overworked and tired from travelling" the Taxi driver nods then and drives you to your Apartment.
You get out and Ignore the cabbie.
you open the gate and Enter your Apartment and lock the Door behind you.
"well thats part one of the plan done now to part two" you think as you head to the fridge to grab a drink.
you take out 3 energy drinks and open them all at once, the sweet Sugar rush helps you forget what you did.
part two of the plan you decide is setting a trap for Kelso
You will give him a address for a abandoned warehouse where he can get his wife back, then once he arrives you will be waiting with a team of Ex Swat guys from your Cop career that are Loyal.
Once you have Kelso in the warehouse you will slowly start leading him away into a Forest nearby. As you do Kelso will be wandering around looking for his Wife and the real kidnapper.
Once Kelso is far enough away you shoot him down with the Ex Swat guys and claim he attacked you.
the SWAT guys will arrive and help you dispose of the Body.

you did all the preparing and wait in the Warehouse with youre team for him to arrive.

After Two Hours Kelso arrives to get his wife back.

You smile to yourself as You watch Kelso pace up and down outside the warehouse. "He looks worried which means he is more likely to get himself killed" You mumble to yourself as you watch him.
Kelso is so focused on getting his wife back that he doesn't see the Ex-Swat guys slowly moving closer to ambush him.
Once Kelso is in the warehouse and the Door is closed you all give the word and you Ex-Swat guys run forward and scream hands up to shot Kelso.
You walk up to him say thats for Betraying me Send Lucifer my regards. You and youre Team starts shooting Kelso down.
After a Few shots Kelso falls dead on the Ground with 4 bullets in his chest.
"Goodbye Kelso" you say as you and the rest of you team start walking away.
"What about his wife" one of the guys asks.

 You say "Dispose of Her"
"We can't risk her talking and helping Kelso's Family find his Body" You reply
"She is just an innocent woman, we can't just kill her"

 You say "Give her an Experimental Amnesia Serum"
You realize that you have just given the perfect alibi for You and your team. The new Woman will Forget Everything that happened that night.
The next morning You wake up with a headache and you realize something is wrong, but its too soon to be sure.
